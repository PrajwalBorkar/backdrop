 *   given element.

 *   Preprocess functions can reformat it by calling format_date() with the
 *   desired parameters on the $comment->created variable.

 *   desired parameters on the $comment->changed variable.

 *   - comment-by-node-author: Comment by the author of the parent node.
 *   - comment-preview: When previewing a new or edited comment.

 *   - comment-unpublished: An unpublished comment visible only to
 *     administrators.
 *   - comment-by-viewer: Comment by the user currently viewing the page.
 *   - comment-new: New comment since last the visit.
 * - $attributes: Array of additional HTML attributes that should be added to
 *   the wrapper element. Flatten with backdrop_attributes().

 *   modules, intended to be displayed in front of the main title tag that
 *   appears in the template.
 * - $title_suffix (array): An array containing additional output populated by
 *   modules, intended to be displayed after the main title tag that appears in
 *   the template.
